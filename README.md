sudo python setup.py install
```

### USAGE:
 - Refer to commented examples in test.py

### REQUIREMENTS:
- Minimum Pre-Requisites: Python2.7x, TensorFlow
- Useful Pre-Requisites: CUDA7.5, PySCF
- To Train Minimally: ~100GB Disk 20GB memory
- To Train Realistically: 1TB Disk, GTX1070++
- To Evaluate: Normal CPU and 10GB Mem
- For volume rendering: CUDA 7.5+ or Mathematica
- ` cd volumeRender; make `
- Or open `/densities/PlotDens.nb`

### COMMON ISSUES
- nan during training due to bad checkpoints in /networks (clean.sh)
- Also crashes when reviving networks from disk.
- if you have these issues try: 

```
cd C_API/
sudo python setup.py install
cd .. 
sh clean.sh 
```
