Yifan's research schedule

2017.3.6

learn the mechanism of "git", structure of branches.
Run the testBP for the first(original task)(it may take more than 5 hours and I will do the next tomorrow)]
There are one questions about the original 
#NolmalizationInput and NolmalizationOutput, I change both of them to False and I know from its name that should be something about normalization but do not know how the results can differ.

2017.3.8
change the parameter in TMParams.py and run the BP in test.py.
try to understand things about deep Neural Networks.
Have two papers to read,
one is from an old deep convolutional imagenet classification paper, the other one is in 2016, the champion paper of imagenet classification named Deep residual learning for image recognition.
