Yifan's research schedule

2017.3.6

learn the mechanism of "git", structure of branches.
Run the testBP for the first(original task)(it may take more than 5 hours and I will do the next tomorrow)]
There are one questions about the original 
#NolmalizationInput and NolmalizationOutput, I change both of them to False and I know from its name that should be something about normalization but do not know how the results can differ.
